This repository is all about hosting and sharing the data and calculations that were done for the paper **Algorithm Configuration Data Mining for CMA Evolution Strategies**. To just check the pre-executed analysis, visit the [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Energya/cma-es-configuration-data-mining/blob/master/module_analysis.ipynb). To interact with it yourself, either fork this repository or use the Binder badge at the top of this page to launch a remote server with everything ready to go!
